        JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
        <br />
        JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

    <h3>Single Line Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-line Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript
        <br />
        Block comments are often used for formal documentation

        which spans across many lines
