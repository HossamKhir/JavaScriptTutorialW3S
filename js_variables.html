    <h3>Using let and const</h3>
    <p>
        the const keyword defines a variable that cannot be reassigned
        <br />
        the let keyword defines a variable with restricted scope
    </p>
    <h3>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs</li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter</li>
        <li>Names can also begin with $ and _</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive</li>
        <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assignment vs Equal to</h3>
    <p>
        the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator
        <br />
        The "equal to" operator is written like ==
    </p>
    <h3>Data Types</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript variables can hold numbers and strings
    </p>
    <h3>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h3>
    <p>
        to declare a variable is to assign some memory to it
        <br />
        by default <code>var</code> assigns the value <code>undefined</code> to any variable that is declared.
        <br />
        like:
    <pre>
            <code>
                var carName;    // this is now holding a value of undefined
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Defining Variables</h3>
    <p>
        to define a variable is to assign some memory to it and pass initial data to it
        <br />
        like:
    <pre>
            <code>
                var carName = "Porsche";    // this is a definition = declaration + assignment
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            <em>
                It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script
                <br />
                Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables will not override the value
            </em>
        </strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Declaring (or defining) multiple variables</h3>
    <p>
        You can declare many variables in one statement.
        <br />
        Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma
        <br />
        A declaration can span on multiple lines
    </p>
    <p>
        If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated
    </p>
    <p>
        Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names
    </p>
    <p>
        Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names
        <br />
        <strong>
            Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to
            use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p id="definition"></p>
    <p id="concat"></p>
    <script>
        var carName = "Porsche";
        var carName;
        document.getElementById('definition').innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
    <script>
        var person = "John Doe", carName = "Porsche", price = 200;
    </script>
    <script>
        var person = "John Doe",
            carName = "Porsche",
            price = 200;
    </script>
    <script>
        var x = "5" + 2 + 3;
        document.getElementById('concat').innerHTML = x;
    </script>
    <script>
        var $$$ = "Hello World";
        var $ = 2;
        var $myMoney = 5;
        var _surName = "Johnson";
        var _x = 2;
        var _100 = 5;
    </script>
