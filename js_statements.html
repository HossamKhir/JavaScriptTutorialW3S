    <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

    <p id="statement"></p>

    <p id="note0"></p>
    <p>
        Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
        <br />
        If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}
    </p>
